Partial agonists are an interesting set of drugs commonly used in psychiatry, Notable examples include Buspirone (5-HT1A) and aripiprazole (D2R).

In my experience, one of the common mistakes people make when thinking about how partial agonists work is that they assume that the behaviour of the medication somehow changes at different doses. Classically, this applies to aripiprazole, where we use lower doses in depression, and higher doses for psychosis and mania. The 5mg "threshold" in this case is not really a threshold at all. The mechanism of action and overall clinical effects can be better understood by clarifying just how a partial agonist works. We'll briefly look at aripiprazole as a case example.

A full agonist will result in receptor activation when bound. An example of a full agonist of the D2 receptor is the endogenous ligand dopamine. Conversely, a full antagonist will block the activity of the endogenous ligand. A partial agonist lies somewhere in between. It does activate its target receptors, but to a lesser degree than the endogenous ligand.

Now, consider that in schizophrenia there is generally hyperactivity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, and *hypo*activation of the mesocortical dopaminergic tract. If aripiprazole, the D2 receptor partial agonist, binds to D2 receptors at the ventral striatum in the presence of excess dopamine release at that locus, then aripiprazole will serve to functionally block dopamine activity there. Although aripiprazole is causing some activation of the D2 receptor, it activates the receptor to far less of a degree than would otherwise have occurred in the presence of excess dopamine. This same activation of dopamine receptors in the cortex will result in functional agonism, since the small degree of dopamine receptor activation by aripiprazole is still greater than that which would result from the small amount of surrounding dopamine.

Since aripiprazole must compete with dopamine for receptors, we can reason that to block ventral striatal D2 receptors in the presence of excess mesolimbic dopamine---ie. to serve as an antipsychotic---the aripiprazole dose needs to be high enough to compete with the excess dopamine. However, lower doses are useful for treatment in cases suggestive of *hypo*dopaminergia, since the aripiprazole does not need to compete with a large amount of dopamine.
